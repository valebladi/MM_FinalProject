The main aim of this project is to reflect scenarios where different modalities can be used. The combination of the modalities is logical for the user, striving to enhance its experience. The project consisted of four tasks and this version represents the outcome of the task, the final gameplay. 

Game  Overview
The game was developed on Unity platform and C# as language, and it is a 2D game based on runners. The goal of the game is to finish two levels where the character will encounter numerous enemies and obstacles. Try not to die before reaching the end, otherwise, start from the beginning.

The game has to input modalities keyboard and speech. The main character is able to perform some task as going forward, backwards, jumping and shooting. The user can control the main character with the keyboard to move right, left and jump. The user can make the character to shoot with voice. 

The use and distribution of these modalities were decided to enhance the users experience and to apply modalities fusion and vision.
